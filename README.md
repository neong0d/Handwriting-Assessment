# Handwriting-Assessment

A language independent system to assess the quality of handwriting among kids and encourage them to further refine it.
A proposed solution to a problem posed by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for **Smart India Hackathon 2022**.

* Used a **centre of gravity** based approach to recognise handwritten bengali characters and achieved above **90% accuracy** with just **92 features**
* Provided a practically achievable handwriting benchmark instead of the obsolete printed standard
* Provides assessment across 3 levels of difficulty to encourage better penmanship in kids

**BUILT WITH**
* [Python](python.org)
* [Scikit-Learn](scikit-learn.org)
* [OpenCV](opencv.org)
* [Colab](colab.research.google.com)
